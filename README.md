# DaisySeedCubeTemplate
**STM32CubeIDE** framework for the **DaisySeed** board, integrating audio codec, SDRAM, and QSPI flash memory management.

The goal is to offer a solid and well-structured starting point for DaisySeed development, handling the boardâ€™s static components so developers can focus on their specific applications.
